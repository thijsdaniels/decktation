All notable changes to Decktation are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.17] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- Restored microphone capture when Decky starts outside the desktop PipeWire
  session, including microphones that support stereo input only.
- Made text injection faster while keeping configurable key and chat delays.

## [0.3.16] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Added Xbox and other Linux gamepad input support alongside Steam Controller
  support, with per-device button mapping overrides.
- Added an option to remember the last chat channel between dictations.
- Added controller diagnostics and a custom Decky store with historical releases
  and development builds.

### Changed

- Switched backend logging to Decky's plugin logs.
- Enabled root permissions for controller device access.
- Improved controller input polling and refreshed the button preview every 100 ms.

### Fixed

- Corrected Xbox Bluetooth face-button and trigger mappings.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added wired and wireless original Steam Controller support using Linux's
  native raw HID report mappings.
- Added privacy-scrubbed Sentry diagnostics and sampled dictation tracing with
  success, preset, and generic controller-type fields.
- Added an opt-in **Share Anonymous Diagnostics** setting, disabled by default.
- Added rate-limited diagnostics for startup imports, model loading, recording,
  transcription, text injection, controller discovery, HID disconnects, and
  listener crashes.

### Changed

- Bundled the Sentry SDK in marketplace builds so client devices do not need
  to install runtime dependencies.

### Fixed

- Removed hostnames, user and request data, IP fields, device metadata, local
  variables, raw exception messages, and other personal data from diagnostic
  events and transactions.
- Fixed legacy local updates installing Python packages directly into
  root-owned plugin directories.
- Ensured marketplace-bundled Python packages take precedence over stale
  dependencies left by legacy installations.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Fixed fresh installations detecting the configured push-to-talk buttons but
  not starting a recording after **Enable Dictation** was switched on.
- Fixed game preset selections reverting to World of Warcraft after the plugin
  panel was reopened.
- Fixed confirm-mode and manual-send settings not reaching the backend.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Clarified that Decky users must install the `decktation.zip` release asset,
  not GitHub's automatically generated source archives.

### Fixed

- Corrected the L5 and R5 labels in the controller button-test display.
- Added one-hot raw HID mapping coverage so swapped or overlapping physical
  button definitions fail automated tests.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Added a Guild Wars 2 preset with game-specific chat channels and vocabulary.
- Added direct Steam Deck HID input for stable push-to-talk controls, including
  the rear L4, L5, R4, and R5 buttons and analog trigger handling.
- Added an in-plugin three-second test recording with transcription preview.
- Added marketplace metadata, third-party notices, pinned backend dependencies,
  and Decky-compatible build documentation.
- Added release tooling to keep package versions and Git tags synchronized.

### Changed

- Migrated backend calls to Decky's current callable API.
- Switched release packaging to the official Decky CLI marketplace builder.
- Bundled a CPython 3.11-compatible inference runtime, PortAudio, `ydotool`, and
  a private `ydotoold` instance for SteamOS compatibility.
- Replaced temporary WAV/PyAV transcription with direct normalized PCM input.
- Moved model loading and transcription off Decky's asynchronous request loop.
- Reduced frontend status polling and prevented overlapping backend requests.

### Fixed

- Fixed the plugin remaining indefinitely on **Initializing** with current
  Decky Loader releases.
- Fixed long transcription times and garbled output caused by resampled
  `int16` microphone samples being passed to Whisper at the wrong scale.
- Fixed test recordings typing their transcription into the active window.
- Fixed native Python modules being built for CPython 3.13 instead of Decky's
  embedded CPython 3.11 runtime.
- Fixed release tags being able to disagree with packaged plugin versions.
- Fixed the GitHub Actions Decky executable colliding with its temporary build
  directory.

### Removed

- Removed the `evdev` runtime dependency.
- Removed the PyAV/FFmpeg runtime dependency from the recording path.
- Removed reliance on a system-wide `ydotoold` service.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use a direct ZIP URL that points to the packaged plugin artifact.
> Recommended short install URL:
> **[`https://silverfoxy.github.io/decktation/latest.zip`](https://silverfoxy.github.io/decktation/latest.zip)**
> Full stable URL:
> **[`https://silverfoxy.github.io/decktation/releases/latest/decktation.zip`](https://silverfoxy.github.io/decktation/releases/latest/decktation.zip)**
> Branch build URL pattern:
> **`https://silverfoxy.github.io/decktation/branches/<url-encoded-branch-name>/decktation.zip`**
> GitHub release assets also work:
> **[`https://github.com/silverfoxy/decktation/releases/latest/download/decktation.zip`](https://github.com/silverfoxy/decktation/releases/latest/download/decktation.zip)**
>
> Do **not** use GitHub's **Source code (zip)** or **Source code (tar.gz)** archives.
> Those do not contain Decktation's bundled Python dependencies.

1. Open **Decky Settings**, enable developer options if necessary, and select
   **Install Plugin from URL** or **Install Plugin from ZIP**.

2. Paste the direct ZIP URL above, or download `decktation.zip` first and then
   choose the file locally. Decky imports the archive and reloads the plugin
   automatically.

For example, branch `feature/chat polish` becomes
`feature%2Fchat%20polish` in the URL path.

All dependencies and the private keyboard helper are pre-bundled in the
release. No system packages or one-time `sudo` setup are required.

### Install from the Decktation store

To make Decktation appear in Decky's plugin browser and receive update
notifications, select **Custom** under **Decky Settings → General → Store
Channel**, then enter:

```text
https://homebrew.imsilverfoxy.com/plugins.json
```

The catalog is updated when a new version tag is published. Switching to a
custom store replaces the catalog shown by Decky's Default or Testing store;
users can switch channels again at any time.

## Usage

1. Open Quick Access Menu (... button on Steam Deck)
2. Navigate to Decktation plugin
3. Select your game from the **Game** dropdown
4. Enable the plugin (waits for Whisper model to load)
5. (Optional) Change the button combination in the plugin UI
6. In any app/game: hold **[button1]+[button2]** together to record, release to transcribe and type

## Game Presets

Decktation ships with three presets configured in `defaults/game_presets.json`:

| Preset | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **World of Warcraft** | Presses Enter to open chat, types channel prefix + message, presses Enter to send |
| **Guild Wars 2** | Presses Enter to focus chat, types the Guild Wars 2 channel command + message, presses Enter to send |
| **Generic** | Types text directly into whatever window is focused — no Enter presses |

### WoW Channel Prefixes

In WoW mode, start your message with a channel name to route it to the right channel:

```
"party let's go"          →  /p let's go
"raid: focus adds first"  →  /raid focus adds first
"say, hello everyone"     →  /s hello everyone
"guild heads up"          →  /g heads up
"type search term"        →  types directly without opening chat
```

Separators supported: space, colon, comma, or period after the channel name. Case-insensitive.

Available WoW channels: `say`, `party`, `raid`, `guild`, `officer`, `yell`, `instance`, `whisper`, `type`

### Guild Wars 2 Channel Prefixes

Guild Wars 2 mode uses the same voice-first flow. For example:

```
"map meta starts in five"       →  /m meta starts in five
"party stack on me"             →  /p stack on me
"squad: ready check"            →  /d ready check
"team push mid"                 →  /t push mid
"guild one hello everyone"      →  /g1 hello everyone
"whisper Player Name hello"     →  /w Player Name hello
```

Available Guild Wars 2 channels: `say`, `map`, `party`, `squad`, `raid` (an alias for squad), `team`, `guild`, `guild one` through `guild six`, `whisper`, `type`.

### Adding Custom Channels

You can add channels beyond the built-in ones (e.g. WoW's numbered channels `/1`, `/2`) by editing two config files.

**Step 1 — add the channel command to `defaults/game_presets.json`** under the preset's `channels` map:

```json
"channels": {
  "say": "/s ",
  "party": "/p ",
  "one": "/1 ",
  "two": "/2 "
}
```

**Step 2 — add the spoken trigger words to `defaults/channel_languages.json`** under each language's `channels` map:

```json
"en": {
  "channels": {
    "one": ["one", "channel one"],
    "two": ["two", "channel two"]
  }
}
```

After saving both files, saying `"one hello"` or `"channel one hello"` will send `/1 hello`.

You can add as many trigger words per channel as you like (e.g., aliases in multiple languages). The key in `defaults/channel_languages.json` must match the key in `defaults/game_presets.json`.

### Adding More Presets

Edit `defaults/game_presets.json` to add new games — no code changes needed. Each preset specifies:
- `chat_open_key` — key to open the chat box (`"enter"` or `null`)
- `chat_send_key` — key to send the message (`"enter"` or `null`)
- `default_channel` — channel to use when no prefix is spoken
- `channels` — map of spoken words to slash-command prefixes
- `whisper_prompt` — vocabulary hint for the Whisper model
- `key_delay` — milliseconds between typed keys (default: `1`)
- `key_hold` — milliseconds each typed key is held down (default: `0`)
- `chat_open_delay` — seconds to wait after opening chat, before typing (default: `0`)
- `chat_send_delay` — seconds to wait after typing, before sending chat (default: `0`)

Timing values are optional. `key_delay` and `key_hold` are whole milliseconds
passed to ydotool, while the chat delays are in seconds.

## Button Configuration

The plugin uses a configurable button combo for push-to-talk. You can set 1–5 buttons from the plugin UI.

Available buttons:

- **L1, R1** (bumpers) — _Default combo_
- **L2, R2** (triggers)
- **L4, R4, L5, R5** (Steam Deck back grips, detected through raw HID)
- **A, B, X, Y** (face buttons)

Controller input combines Linux evdev gamepad events with Valve raw HID reports.
Xbox and other Linux gamepads can use face buttons, bumpers, and triggers without
a device-ID allowlist. Steam Deck raw input preserves L4/R4/L5/R5 and combos
mixing grips with other buttons, independently of Steam Input layouts. Original
Steam Controllers retain raw L5/R5 grip support on wired/USB receiver connections;
other connections can use evdev when a gamepad is exposed by Linux or Steam Input.
Generic evdev input follows the exposed gamepad layout; a keyboard/mouse-only
Steam Input layout may not expose usable gamepad buttons. Third-party paddles
are not universally exposed as distinct buttons, so use a standard-button combo
on those controllers. Face-button names follow Xbox positions.

Controllers are detected automatically when connected. Each combo must be held
on one input device; disconnecting it releases push-to-talk.

## Use Cases

### Gaming

- **WoW chat**: Dictate messages with correct channel routing (party, raid, guild, etc.)
- **Generic text input**: Type player names, search terms, chat in any game without a keyboard

### General

- **Web browsing**: Fill forms, search, comment
- **Discord/messaging**: Send messages hands-free
- **Any text input**: Works in any active window using the Generic preset

## WoW Context Support (Optional)

For improved accuracy with WoW-specific vocabulary, install the included WoW addon and run `convert_wow_context.py --watch`. It reads your current zone, target, party members, and class/spec from the game and feeds them to Whisper as context.

See `doc/TESTING_GUIDE.md` for setup instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not showing up

- Check Decky Loader logs: `/tmp/decky-*.log`
- Ensure all Python dependencies are installed
- Restart Decky Loader

### Plugin logs

Decktation uses `decky.logger`, including forwarded controller-listener output.
Decky writes timestamped `.log` files in `DECKY_PLUGIN_LOG_DIR`, normally
`/home/deck/homebrew/logs/decktation/`. Open the newest file for the current
session; after a plugin restart, Decky creates a new log file.

```bash
ls -lt /home/deck/homebrew/logs/decktation/*.log
```

The plugin no longer creates `/tmp/decktation.log`. This logging change does
not migrate the controller's separate `/tmp` state files or change plugin
privileges.

### Recording not working

- Ensure the plugin is enabled
- Check that Steam Deck mic is working (test in another app)
- Check `/home/deck/homebrew/logs/decktation/*.log` for `ydotoold ready`
- Check logs: `/home/deck/homebrew/logs/decktation/*.log`

### Button combo not detected

The button preview shows currently held buttons on the backend's selected
controller, including triggers, using the same mappings as recording combos.
It clears on release and refreshes every 100 ms while the panel is mounted.

#### Custom controller mappings

Create `controller_mappings.json` in the plugin settings directory (normally
`/home/deck/homebrew/settings/decktation/`). Each key is a lowercase hexadecimal
`bus:vendor:product` ID, with four digits per component. For example, this
explicitly maps X/Y for the Bluetooth Xbox `045e:02fd`:

```json
{
  "0005:045e:02fd": {
    "0x133": "X",
    "0x134": "Y"
  }
}
```

Values may be `A`, `B`, `X`, `Y`, `L1`, `R1`, `L2`, or `R2`. Keys are Linux
evdev button codes written as hex strings (not Steam button IDs). Unspecified
codes retain their built-in mapping. This config overrides digital buttons;
analog trigger axes still use automatic detection. Controllers must expose
the standard A/B capabilities to be discovered.

Use controller diagnostics and `Controller input` log lines to identify the
device and its raw codes. Restart the plugin or reconnect the controller after
editing; mappings are read when devices open. Invalid overrides are logged and
ignored. USB and Bluetooth IDs can differ, and Steam's virtual controller is a
separate device with its own mapping.

Xbox evdev devices and Steam's virtual Xbox pads use Xbox X/Y button labels;
other evdev gamepads use the default positional mapping. Steam Deck raw HID
input is decoded separately. Button-change logs include the device path,
decoded held buttons, and held evdev key codes to distinguish physical input
from Steam's virtual output. If a controller still mismatches, capture separate
X and Y presses from the same device before changing its mapping.

- Try a different button combination in the plugin UI
- Rear grip buttons are supported on Steam Deck hardware through raw HID
- Check `/home/deck/homebrew/logs/decktation/*.log` for controller listener errors
- Verify controller listener is running: `pgrep -f controller_listener`

### Performance on Steam Deck

- Default `base` model is recommended (good balance)
- For faster: use `tiny` model (edit wow_voice_chat.py line 28)
- For accuracy: use `small` model (slower, needs more resources)

## Technical Details

- **Speech recognition**: faster-whisper (CTranslate2 backend)
- **Model**: base (150MB, ~2-4s transcription time)
- **Input**: Steam Deck microphone or connected headset
- **Controller input**: Linux evdev gamepads plus Valve raw HID for physical Deck controls and grips
- **Output**: Keyboard simulation via ydotool (bundled)
- **Game presets**: `defaults/game_presets.json` — data-driven, no code changes needed to add games
- **Dependencies**: Pre-bundled Python 3.11 libraries in `lib/` folder
- **Architecture**: TypeScript frontend + Python backend + separate controller listener process

## Development

```bash
npm install           # Install Node dependencies (package-lock.json is ignored)
npm run build         # Compile TypeScript to dist/index.js
npm run watch         # Watch mode for development

# Unit tests (no hardware required)
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install pytest sentry-sdk==2.66.0
.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v
```

CI runs unit tests and the TypeScript build on every push via GitHub Actions.

## Privacy

- **Voice data stays local.** Recording, transcription, chat parsing, and
  simulated keyboard input run on your Steam Deck. Decktation does not upload
  audio recordings, transcribed text, or WoW context data.
- **Model downloads.** The first use of each selected Whisper model downloads
  its model files from Hugging Face. This requires an internet connection;
  subsequent use is local while the model remains cached on the device.
- **Optional diagnostics.** The **Diagnostics → Share** setting is off by
  default. When enabled, Decktation sends scrubbed error and performance data
  to Sentry to help diagnose failures. It excludes audio, transcription text,
  WoW context, credentials, device/host identifiers, IP addresses, and paths
  containing the local user name. Diagnostics include the plugin release,
  error category/type, selected game preset, and whether dictation succeeded.
  Controller diagnostics include family, vendor/product IDs (model identifiers,
  not unique serials), USB/Bluetooth/virtual connection, evdev/raw HID backend,
  configured combo and supported buttons, connected input-source count, first
  input received, dropped-event recovery count, connection lifecycle, and
  numeric input errors or listener exit code. Controller names, serial numbers,
  Bluetooth addresses, and individual button-press streams are not uploaded.
- You can disable diagnostics at any time from the plugin’s Diagnostics
  section; no diagnostics connection is initialized while the setting is off.

## Permissions

Decktation declares Decky’s `_root` permission solely for the Steam Deck
devices required by push-to-talk and text input:

- It reads Valve raw controller reports from `/dev/hidraw*` so the configured
  physical button combination works independently of a game’s Steam Input
  layout.
- It also reads gamepad events from `/dev/input/event*` for other controllers,
  without exclusively grabbing devices or changing their mappings.
- It runs its bundled `ydotoold` helper against `/dev/uinput` to simulate the
  keystrokes that enter the transcription in the active window. The helper uses
  a private, owner-only socket in `/tmp` and is stopped when the plugin unloads.
- Dictated text is passed as data to `ydotool`; it is never evaluated as a
  shell command. Decktation does not modify the system filesystem, install
  system packages, or create system services.
